Solution Engineering Data Specialist Challenge

We'd love to move forward to the next step: the take-home challenge. This is somewhat less structured and the point is to see a realistic work product from you that's relevant to your prospective role.

Thank you for being willing to do this challenge. FullStory fosters an empowered and autonomous culture, with the opportunity to tackle new challenges as we scale. We hope this provides a taste for the types of scenarios you might encounter on the job!


Scenario:
You are a Fullstory Solutions Engineering Data Specialist and Fullstory has an active opportunity with Cargo. Cargo is a C2C car rental site where car owners can list their cars to be rented by car renters. 

You’ve been brought in to demonstrate the power of leveraging Fullstory data as a behavioral data source to positively impact Cargo’s business. Some possible uses for this behavioral data include:
- Business intelligence and reporting
- Site personalization
- Product recommendations
- Call center deflection

We have some theories about places where there might be issues. Feel free to use these as starting points for your analysis.
- We’re concerned about account takeover fraud for car hosts. We’ve had some reports of people having their funds drained by bad actors but not sure where to start.
- We recently launched a new search and filter feature on our search page and have some reports of some bugs associated with that feature set but don’t have anything quantifiable pointing to the cause.
- We’re interested in using user behavior to power car suggestions on product pages but currently we lack enough behavioral data to train a model. Can Fullstory help here

Your challenge is to present back to the Cargo Chief Data Officer and their data team examples of the value you were able to generate from analyzing Cargo’s data.

You’ll use this linked slide deck as your template and create no more than 5 slides to demonstrate and present your work.

Audience
- CDO
- VP Business Analytics
- VP Data Infrastructure
- Manager Data Engineering

Instructions 
This is designed to be a take home exercise where you will use your skills and experience to analyze the data. There is no time limit on this project as the project completion comes in the form of a presentation to the hiring team.
Please submit via the Ashby link provided in the email containing the Challenge instructions.

We only expect you to look at event_data.json but we have also provided user_data.json.gz as an optional extra data source for further analysis. 

event_data.json is split across the multiple event_data_ files, you can use the following command via a terminal to extract event_data.json when in the same directory as the files: cat event_data_a? | gunzip > event_data.json

Deliverable Format 
Provide your presentation in Google Slides form and utilize speaker notes or an accompanying Google Doc to walk through any of the work in which you took pride but might not be directly spoken to in your presentation. 
This challenge is designed to explore your familiarity with working in unique data sets, test your creativity in data analysis, and understand your comfort level presenting to an executive team in a pre-sales (selling) capacity.
